# Feature Specification: Book Chapter Content Organization

**Feature Branch**: `1-book-chapter-content`  
**Created**: 2025-11-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "now write the specs for writing chapters for book also update a spec.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Instructor Course Overview (Priority: P1)

As a course instructor, I want to view the entire "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course content organized into clear modules and weekly lessons within the Docusaurus textbook, so that I can easily understand the curriculum structure and plan my lectures.

**Why this priority**: Essential for any instructor to use the textbook as a teaching aid. Without a clear overview, the course cannot be effectively taught.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating the Docusaurus sidebar and main content areas to verify the presence and logical flow of all modules, chapters, and weekly lesson topics as derived from the hackathon MD file.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am an instructor viewing the Docusaurus textbook, **When** I navigate to the main documentation page, **Then** I see a sidebar with 4 main modules (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA).
2.  **Given** I am an instructor viewing the Docusaurus textbook, **When** I expand a module in the sidebar, **Then** I see a list of lessons corresponding to the weekly breakdown for that module.
3.  **Given** I am an instructor viewing the Docusaurus textbook, **When** I click on any lesson, **Then** I see comprehensive content for that topic.

### User Story 2 - Student Learning Path (Priority: P1)

As a student, I want to easily navigate through the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook, with content clearly structured into chapters and lessons, so that I can follow the learning path and gain complete knowledge of each topic.

**Why this priority**: Crucial for student engagement and effective learning. A well-organized learning path directly impacts student success.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting any module and sequentially moving through its lessons, verifying that each lesson's content is present and directly addresses the topic from the hackathon MD file.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am a student accessing a chapter in the Docusaurus textbook, **When** I complete a lesson, **Then** I can easily proceed to the next lesson in the logical sequence.
2.  **Given** I am a student viewing a lesson, **When** I read the content, **Then** I find all relevant information for the topic, as derived from the hackathon MD file.

### User Story 3 - Quick Reference for Specific Information (Priority: P2)

As a student or instructor, I want to quickly find specific information such as hackathon requirements, timeline, assessments, or hardware needs within the textbook, so that I can use it as a reference guide.

**Why this priority**: Important for practical aspects of the hackathon and course administration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating directly to or searching for specific supplementary sections like "Hardware Requirements" and verifying their content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am looking for hackathon requirements, **When** I access the textbook, **Then** I can locate a dedicated section detailing all hackathon requirements.
2.  **Given** I am looking for hardware requirements, **When** I access the textbook, **Then** I can locate a dedicated section detailing all necessary hardware specifications.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a section from the hackathon MD file has very little content? The Docusaurus page should still be created, perhaps with a note indicating brevity or linking to a more comprehensive section.
- How does the system handle potential inconsistencies between the hackathon MD structure and Docusaurus's autogenerated sidebar? The file naming and folder structure will explicitly define the hierarchy.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The Docusaurus textbook MUST be structured into 4 main chapters, corresponding to the "Quarter Overview" modules (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA).
- **FR-002**: Each main chapter MUST contain sub-sections (lessons) derived from the "Weekly Breakdown" topics and the detailed module descriptions in the `Hackathon_ Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook.md` file.
- **FR-003**: Each lesson's content MUST be extracted directly and comprehensively from the `Hackathon_ Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook.md` file, ensuring complete information for a student.
- **FR-004**: The textbook MUST include dedicated, clearly accessible sections for:
    - Hackathon Requirements
    - Hackathon Timeline
    - Course Assessments
    - Hardware Requirements
    - "Why Physical AI Matters"
    - Learning Outcomes
- **FR-005**: The Docusaurus sidebar MUST accurately reflect the hierarchical structure of chapters and lessons, allowing for intuitive navigation.
- **FR-006**: The introductory page (`docs/intro.md`) MUST be updated with relevant overview content from the `Hackathon_ Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook.md` file, such as the "Excel in the Hackathon..." section or a concise course summary.

### Key Entities

- **Textbook Content**: The raw information on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics from the hackathon MD file.
- **Module**: A top-level organizational unit (e.g., ROS 2, Gazebo).
- **Chapter**: Corresponds directly to a Module in the Docusaurus structure.
- **Lesson**: A sub-section within a chapter, detailing a specific topic or weekly content.
- **Docusaurus Site**: The web platform hosting the organized textbook.
- **Sidebar**: The navigation component in Docusaurus displaying the content hierarchy.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of all content sections and topics identified in `Hackathon_ Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook.md` are present and correctly organized within the Docusaurus textbook.
- **SC-002**: The average time taken for an instructor to find a specific weekly lesson's content (e.g., "Weeks 3-5: ROS 2 Fundamentals") is less than 30 seconds.
- **SC-003**: User feedback (post-implementation) indicates that the textbook's content organization is rated 4.5/5 or higher for clarity and ease of navigation.
- **SC-004**: All mandatory sections (Requirements, Timeline, Assessments, Hardware Requirements, Why Physical AI Matters, Learning Outcomes) are accessible via the Docusaurus sidebar or main navigation.

## Assumptions

- The existing Docusaurus project (`physical-ai-book`) is functional and correctly configured.
- The `sidebars.ts` file's `autogenerated` feature will handle the display of new markdown files effectively.
- All required content for the textbook can be extracted solely from the provided `Hackathon_ Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook.md` file.
- No new content generation or external research is required for this phase.

## Constraints

- The textbook structure MUST adhere strictly to the 4 modules outlined in the `Hackathon_ Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook.md`.
- The primary goal is to organize and present existing content, not to create new content.
- The final output must be compatible with Docusaurus's markdown and front matter conventions.
