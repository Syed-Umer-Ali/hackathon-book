# Course Assessments

## Overview

The "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course employs a project-based assessment approach to evaluate students' practical skills and theoretical understanding. Each module culminates in a hands-on project that directly reflects the concepts and tools learned.

## Assessment Breakdown

*   **ROS 2 Package Development Project:** Students will develop a ROS 2 package demonstrating their ability to utilize ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions for robotic control.
*   **Gazebo Simulation Implementation:** A project focused on creating and manipulating simulated environments and robots within Gazebo, including physics and sensor simulation.
*   **Isaac-Based Perception Pipeline:** Development of a perception pipeline using NVIDIA Isaac Platform, showcasing skills in AI-powered perception, synthetic data generation, or VSLAM.
*   **Capstone Project: Simulated Humanoid Robot with Conversational AI:** The final project integrating knowledge from all modules, involving a simulated humanoid robot performing complex tasks based on conversational AI commands.
