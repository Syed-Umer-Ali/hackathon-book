# Preface: Unveiling the Future of Embodied AI

Welcome to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics," a comprehensive textbook designed to guide you through the exciting convergence of artificial intelligence and the physical world. In an era where intelligent agents and robots are becoming integral partners in various aspects of life and work, understanding the principles and applications of embodied AI is no longer a niche interest but a fundamental skill for innovators and engineers alike.

This book is crafted for students, researchers, and professionals eager to bridge the gap between digital intelligence and physical reality. We delve into the intricacies of designing, simulating, and deploying humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions. Our journey will cover the foundational "nervous system" provided by ROS 2, the "digital twin" environments of Gazebo and Unity, the advanced "AI-robot brain" powered by NVIDIA Isaac, and the cutting-edge fusion of large language models with robotics through Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

Our goal is to equip you with the knowledge and practical skills to navigate this rapidly evolving field. Each chapter is meticulously structured to provide clear explanations, key concepts, and practical insights, preparing you to contribute to a future where intelligent machines collaborate seamlessly with humans.

Join us as we explore how AI moves beyond the screen to shape the physical world.
